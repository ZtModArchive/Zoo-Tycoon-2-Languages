		You were approached by a scientific journal writing an educational article about 
		even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyls). They want three specific pictures
		and offered you $750 per picture. If you photograph a 
		dromedary camel, a gemsbok, and a Thomson's gazelle, you get $2,250. The 
		resulting publicity should also boost your zoo fame.
