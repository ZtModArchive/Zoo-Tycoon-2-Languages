		The iron bar fence is a sturdy and long-lasting option when building fences. Plus, it 
		won't block your zoo guests' views of the animals in their exhibits.  Animals cannot climb or jump the 
		iron bar fence. Some animals can jump the low iron bar fence.

                  A chain-link fence can be a good fencing option when you're on a tight budget. Although some primates may climb on a chain-link fence, few animals can jump over it.

               Plexiglas fencing is one of the strongest, most effective types of fencing you can use for an animal exhibit; 
               your zoo guests can see through it even as it keeps them safe from the animals they are observing.

                  The wooden slat fence is an average-strength fence that does an acceptable job of keeping animals in their exhibits, but zoo guests cannot see animals that are completely surrounded by wooden slat fencing.

               The post and rope fence is a moderately durable fencing option that looks mostly decorative, but is actually somewhat effective in containing certain animals in their exhibits. 
               While strong animals will bash right through it, many other animals will not be able to climb or jump over it.

               Using white picket fencing to contain large animals is a recipe for disaster, but white picket fences can be an attractive addition to your landscape design. 
               They make particularly attractive border for picnic and food service areas.

                  The stone wall is one of the strongest, most durable fencing options you can choose in Zoo Tycoon 2. 
 The only disadvantage to using it is that zoo guests cannot see animals in exhibits completely surrounded by stone walls.

                  When visibility is crucial, you can always use the low stone wall, which combines strength with a low height that allows guests to see over it.

               Fencing that reflects a safari theme is best used when building exhibits for savannah animals, including zebras, giraffes, and lions. 
               You can also use safari fencing to create themed public areas adjacent to savannah exhibits. Guests appreciate visiting themed areas.

               Every exhibit you build needs a staff gate, which gives member of your zoo staff direct access to your animals. 
               Staff gates are also useful when they are placed on paths to block guests from certain areas of your zoo. 
               Only members of your zoo staff, including zookeepers, animal educators, and maintenance workers, can pass through staff gates.

               A concrete fence is one of the strongest barrier-type fences available. It can withstand 
               repeated bashing by animals, and most primates won't be able to climb over it. Keep in mind, 
               though, that zoo guests will not be able to see animals that are enclosed in an exhibit 
               surrounded completely by high concrete fencing. While low concrete fencing provides better visibility,
               some animals will be able to jump this low barrier.
