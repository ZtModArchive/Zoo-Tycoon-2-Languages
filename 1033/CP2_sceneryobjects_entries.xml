                  <br/>The extinct-themed decorative tar pit demonstrates what happens when crude oil bubbles to the Earth's surface and forms a sticky pool of asphalt. In nature, the heavy tar has preserved animal bones and teeth for tens of thousands of years. A stone saber-toothed cat in search of higher ground draws curious guests to the decorative tar pit's bubbling ooze, which is safe -- but can be very sticky for guests.
