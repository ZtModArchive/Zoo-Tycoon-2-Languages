                  The same holds true when you are recycling buildings, paths, fences, etc. To recycle all objects, regardless of their type, from the terrain, click on an area that is free of objects, and then sweep your mouse over the terrain.

		To learn about the basics (and beyond) of building and maintaining the perfect zoo, it's a good idea to complete the tutorial 
		campaigns featured in Campaign game mode. These tutorials cover everything from changing views to digging ditches to adopting 
		animals, and they serve as the perfect introduction to Zoo Tycoon 2.

         There are four different ways to view all of the action in your zoo. You can switch between views by clicking on the view buttons 
         that appear in the lower left corner of the game window.

		The overview map is most useful when you want to locate and go to a specific object in your zoo. For example, you may need 
		to locate a specific brown bear in the zoo that needs your attention. In overview map view, all you have to do is click the 
		brown bear icon on the map, and the view will jump to that animal.

		The overview map includes icons that represent all of the paths, buildings, and animals currently placed in your zoo. You can 
		click on an object's icon on the map to move directly to that object's current location.

		Overhead view is most useful when you are working on your zoo layout, placing paths and fences, building exhibits, 
		and placing buildings.

		You can use the arrow controls on the main game panel to rotate your view in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction,

		Zoo Guest mode is the first-person view in Zoo Tycoon 2 that lets you get up close and personal with both your animal inhabitants 
		and with your zoo guests.

		In Zoo Guest mode, you can view your zoo through the eyes of the guests who flock through your entrance gates, but you also 
		have the option of taking it one step further.

		In Zoo Guest mode, you can take on all the tasks that are usually assigned to a zookeeper, from feeding and watering animals to 
		grooming and healing them, even cleaning up piles of their poop.

		To complete a zookeeper task on your own in Zoo Guest mode, all you have to do is approach an animal and then follow the 
		on-screen instructions.

		It's important to remember that you can save yourself the cost of hiring a zookeeper if you take on zookeeper duties yourself 
		in Zoo Guest mode.

         for the future growth and expansion of your zoo.

		By taking a moment to stop and strategize before throwing cash, fencing, and path tiles willy-nilly, you can save money in the 
		short term while also creating a more hospitable environment for both your resident animals and their guests.

		1. Wide open spaces are a good thing. Spread things out to leave room for future expansion, and don't bunch your zoo's biggest 
		attractions all in one place. 
		
               
               
               
               
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  <p/>
                  <br/>
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                     
               
               
               
               
		2. A standard grid layout, with paths around large exhibits or groups of smaller exhibits, can be a solid way to start. Just make 
		sure that the animals have enough room in any smaller exhibits.
		
               
               
               
               
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  <p/>
                  <br/>
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                     
               
               
               
               
		3. A fork layout, in which your zoo's main paths are divided by a space 2–5 tiles wide, is another good option for zoos designed 
		to accommodate large numbers of guests. Populate the open spaces with guest amenities and scenery objects, or create 
		additional paths to ease traffic flow.

		4. In general, bigger is better when it comes to building exhibits. The more animals an exhibit contains, the more attractive 
		the exhibit and the more money people will put into your donation boxes. Zoo guests also receive more educational value from 
		exhibits with multiple animals.

		5. Place gift shops and ATMs near the entrance to your zoo to encourage guests to make purchases before they exit.

		6. To encourage traffic flow, place the exhibits for the most popular animals in the farthest reaches of your zoo. This will 
		encourage your guests to dine, shop, stroll, and spend more time in your zoo.

		7. Build observation areas between a path and an exhibit. Simply lay down a short stretch of pathway alongside the exhibit. 
		This gives guests a place to view the exhibit without clogging the pathways.

		8. Whenever possible, include the zoo perimeter wall as part of an exhibit's fencing. This saves money on fences, and also 
		encourages building exhibits on the outer edges of your zoo.

		9. Your zoo's visual aesthetics make a big impact on the happiness levels of your guests. Don't be afraid to invest in 
		flowerbeds, fountains, and other scenery objects with visual (even if not practical) appeal. Guests enjoy looking at neat 
		objects like themed trash cans and food stands.

	10. Place staff gates to keep guests out of areas you don't want them to visit. Only staff members may pass through staff gates.

		You can take the guesswork out of the plant selection process and unlock the mysteries of exhibit foliage placement when you

		Whether you're creating an exhibit based on an African savannah, Arctic tundra, a tropical rain forest, wetlands, or a desert 
		biome, the biome brush offers a shortcut to finding and placing the best types of plants, trees, shrubs, grasses, rocks, 
		and water types for that specific environment, all at a reasonable cost.

		Although zoo guests like to see the animals up close, respect your animals' need for privacy. Building exhibits with a 
		combination of solid and clear walls is a good way to take care of both your animals' and your zoo guests' needs.

		Experiment with creating large multi-species exhibits that house more than one kind of animal. For example, a mixed-use 
		savannah exhibit can potentially accommodate black rhinos, common zebras, reticulated giraffes, elephants, Thomson's gazelles 
		and, the "King of Beasts," the lion. Guests love to see multiple kinds of animals co-existing in an exhibit and, as a result, 
		will put more money in your donation boxes.

and then move the mouse to place additional fence sections in any shape you like.

                  You can also stretch the fence like a rubber band (thus, the name). When you're finished, click the mouse button to release the

 Rectangular fence placement mode works best when you want to create a square- or rectangular-shaped fenced area automatically. 
		Click to start placing the fence, and then move the mouse to adjust the size of the fenced area. Click again to place the enclosure.

		After you create the fenced enclosure, you will be prompted to place a staff gate (this gives your zookeepers direct access 
		to the animals within the enclosure) and a donation box (at least one should be placed near each exhibit to encourage donation 
		from guests).

                  Octagonal fence placement mode is perfect for creating more rounded fence enclosures. It works the same way as rectangular fence placement mode. Click to start placing your fence, and then move the mouse to adjust the size of the fenced area. Click again to place the 
		enclosure.

        When placing paths, it's a good idea to focus on ensuring the smooth flow of guest traffic through your zoo by placing paths 
        that are wide enough (three tiles wide, for example) to accommodate large numbers of guests. You want to avoid bottlenecks 
        in food service areas and also make sure your guests are encouraged to explore every nook and cranny of the amazing zoo 
        environment you've created.

		It's important to place the front of buildings in locations where guests can easily enter and exit. If you position the 
		front of a building or object in a location where guests can't access it, your chances for high sales volume are slim.

                  <i>Number of Animals</i>
                  <br/>
		The more animals you have in your zoo, the more famous it becomes. Add animals to your zoo to increase your fame.

                  <i>Educational Habitats</i>
                  <br/>
		Guests are educated by seeing animals in their native habitats. If you make sure each animal in your zoo is in an appropriate habitat then your zoo is more educational. Educational zoos are more famous.
                  <p/>
                  <i>Entertaining Animals</i>
                  <br/>
		Guests like having a good view of healthy, happy, and active animals. They also like rare and exotic animals. To ensure guests are enjoying your animals make sure the animals are happy, they have lots of things to do, and that guests can view them from close-up.

                  <i>Goals</i>
                  <br/>

                  <i>Release to Wild</i>
                  <br/>

		Once you’ve adopted an animal and placed it in your zoo, it’s time to focus on meeting its basic and advanced needs.

		The Animal Information panel, which you can view by clicking on any animal in your zoo, provides a summary of each 
		individual animal’s current basic and advanced needs status, as well as information about its preferred environments.

		Visits from the zookeeper -- Animals will always respond positively to individual attention from a zookeeper. In Zoo Guest 
		mode, you can take on all of a zookeeper’s tasks yourself, from feeding and watering to grooming and healing sick animals.

		The companionship of other animals -- Even the most solitary of animals in your zoo would probably be happier sharing their

		Animals reproducing in your zoo is one of your ultimate signs of success—it means you have satisfied the basic and advanced 
		needs of the fledgling’s parents, making them so happy and comfortable that they’ve had time to turn their attention to each other.

		You also get economic benefits from the birth of an animal. Zoo guests find baby animals more interesting than adult 
		animals—this means they spend more time watching them and may even be inspired to donate more money to your zoo.

                  1. Give 'em room. Build paths that leave plenty of elbow room for the crowds. Large viewing areas near popular exhibits also 
		keep crowds happy. 
		
               
               
               
               
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  <p/>
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  2. Keep it clean. Placing recycling bins and trash cans around your zoo can help keep things spotless. 
		
               
               
               
               
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  <p/>
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  3. Showcase popular animals, and include as many different species as possible (this will have a huge effect on your zoo fame score!). 
		
               
               
               
               
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  <p/>
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  4. Provide facilities where guests can be fed, watered, and rested, and they'll be happy. They're not so different from your animal 
		inhabitants, in fact. 
		
               
               
               
               
                 
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  <p/>
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  5. Encourage reproduction among your animals. Zoo guests love baby animals. 
		
               
               
               
               
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  <p/>
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  6. Experiment with changing the price of zoo admission and zoo concessions until you find the perfect balance between keeping 
		guests happy (and spending!) and maximizing your profit potential. 
		
               
               
               
               
                 
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  <p/>
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  7. Guests like to be amused while in the zoo. In addition to viewing animals, they like to admire interesting statues, fountains, 
		and themed areas. Kids love to play on playground equipment. 
		
               
               
               
               
                 
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  <p/>
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  8. Pay attention to your zoo's aesthetics. Flowers and fountains can make a real difference in your guests' happiness levels. 
		
               
               
               
               
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  <p/>
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  9. Guests are happiest when viewing happy, healthy animals in well-designed exhibits. 
		
               
               
               
               
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  <p/>
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  10. Guests also want to be educated. Seeing animals in exhibits that represent their natural biomes may prompt guests to donate 
		more money to your zoo.

		You can also turn poop into profits by building a compost building in a discreet location away from food service areas and 
		your zoo guests. 
                  <p/>
		Guests will throw the trash from the coffee and sparkling water stands in recyling bins. When these bins are emptied you will generate some profit.
