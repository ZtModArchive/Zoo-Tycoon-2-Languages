      A prominent zoo would like to open a new sister facility to display an exhibit area featuring three different species of animals from North America. However, due to foreign content restrictions established by the ruling government, these species must represent less than 30% of the species on exhibit.
      <p/>
      To include three species from North America in your zoo and be within the regulations, you must have at least eight different species that are from regions other than North America.
      <p/>
      Note: Arctic animals such as the polar bear also count as North American animals for this scenario. (Antarctic animals such as the emperor penguin do not qualify.)
