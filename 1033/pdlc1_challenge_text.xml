A group of scientists developed a process to create dinosaur eggs. By paying a sponsorship fee, you can get one of their first eggs, but the scientists can't guarantee the species. You might get a more common Styracosaurus or a rare Tyrannosaurus rex. To accept this challenge, pay the $12,000 sponsorship fee for the new dinosaur to be delivered in a crate near your zoo's entrance.
