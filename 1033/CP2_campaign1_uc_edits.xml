      (Optional) If you were to create an extraordinary woolly rhino at the Extinct Research Lab, your zoo&apos;s fame and guests would increase! Hint: You need to find the woolly rhino fossils before you can create one at the Extinct Research Lab.
      <p/>
      To create a super woolly rhino, you need to find its fossil pieces first. Take out your fossil-finding tools and get to work! A local paleontology club offered to donate some tools, if you prove there are fossils from a woolly rhino in your zoo.
