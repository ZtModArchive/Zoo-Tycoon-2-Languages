Your tapirs are doing great! All of their basic needs are being met.
      <p/>
Now that your tapirs are happy and healthy, the town council wants you to get your little zoo on firm financial footing. Raise $3,000 in animal donations to prove that you can attract visitors to your zoo.

      <LOC_STRING _locID="EndangeredAnimals:BairdsTapirColony" version="6"  >
Good job! Your zoo has raised more than $3,000 in animal donations. The members of the town council are pleased with your progress.
      <p/>
They are so pleased, in fact, that they have asked you to expand your colony of Baird's tapirs. Make a tapir exhibit containing five or more tapirs to win the scenario!
      <p/>
You can get five tapirs either by breeding the tapirs you have or by adopting new ones. Adoption is fast but expensive. Breeding is extremely slow but free.
